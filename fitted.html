        <p>A user interface design case study for Fitted - a responsive web app designed to help everyday people achieve their fitness goals. I designed user task flows for key features, transformed them into
          wireframes using Sketch and Balsamiq, and then created a high-fidelity prototype using
          Invision. I also established a comprehensive style guide with my color, typography, and
          imagery decisions.</p>

          <p>CONTEXT: This project was completed in CareerFoundry’s User Interface Design course. I
            was the sole UX/UI designer for this project.</p>
          <p>THE CHALLENGE: Motivate people into an exercise routine that fits their level, schedule,
            and interests in a responsive web app.</p>

            <p>The first step was to create a persona to maintain a clear vision of who this app is designed to serve. <br>
              Meet Rebecca:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Job: Software Devloper - tech savvy, sedentary job</li>
              <li>Experience Level: Beginner</li>
              <li>Environment: Lives in an apartment without a gym with her boyfriend and 3 year old daughter</li>

                lot of time for exercising.</li>
              <li>As a beginner to working out, Rebecca also wants something that will help her learn
                how to properly exercise.</li>
              <li>Rebecca wants help finding routines she can enjoy.</li>

              <li>Rebecca wants to be able to find exercises that match her goals of losing weight and
                getting in shape.</li>
              <li>In addition, she wants to find short exercises that she can do multiple times per day in
                between other activities.</li>
              <li>She wants the tool to keep her motivated as well, as her schedule can often be
                distracting.</li>

            <p>User Stories</p>
            <ul>
              <li>As a new user, I want to learn about different exercises, so that I can figure out what is
                best for me.</li>
              <li>As a new user, I want to be shown how the exercises are done, so that I know I’m
                doing them correctly.</li>
              <li>As a frequent user, I want to be able to schedule exercises for working out, so that I
                build positive habits.</li>
              <li>As a frequent user, I want to be able to earn achievements or rewards, so that I can
                stay motivated.</li>
              <li>As a frequent user, I want to complete daily challenges, so that I can have an
                additional way to stay motivated.</li>
              <li>As a frequent user, I want to track progression and record what I’ve done, so that I
                can see my progress over time.</li>
              <li>As a frequent user, I want to be able to share routines with my friends who may also

                    <source srcset="img/fitted/task-flows/taskflow-challenge-1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

                </div>
                <p>With a deeper understanding of the problem and the proto-persona, I developed task
                  flows to begin the ideation process. Task flows inform the information architecture (or
                  layout) of a project. By laying out each step users will take in achieving their goal, I
                  generated ideas on how to best design each screen to make it as easy and enjoyable
                  as possible for the user.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>Next comes the fun part. After creating task flows based on my persona, I mapped out
              early wireframes of the screens using Balsamiq. These wireframes are the fields in
              which the user flows take place.
              From the user stories, I developed wireframes to help Rebecca with the following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Search and filter workouts</li>
              <li>Start a workout challenge (or competition) with a friend</li>
              <li>View a video tutorial of the workout</li>
              <li>Add the workouts to a routine</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Grids</h3>
            <p>With sketches quickly drawn on Balsamiq, I opened up Sketch to create a more
              organized view of these drawings using grids. I use a 12 column grid on my mobile
              design sketches because users are already familiar with this layout. This process is
              another opportunity for me to visually brainstorm my lo-fi wireframes.</p>

            <h3>Mid Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>With the information architecture in place, I brought in interface design elements to
              make the app look more real.
              As I increased the fidelity of these wireframes, I focused on the 6 following visual design
              elements:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Visual Hierarchy and Spacing</li>
              <li>UI Design Patterns</li>

            <p>I like to keep things fairly big picture leading up to this stage, prioritizing layout decisions

          <div>
            <h4>Designing the "My Routine" page</h4>
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img/fitted/mid-fidelity/midfi-routine-options-1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
              <img src="img/fitted/mid-fidelity/midfi-routines-option-2x.jpg" alt="My Image">
            </picture>
            <p>At the mid-fidelity stage, I came to a major decision point. There were many options that
              could work for the “My Routine” page . I asked myself “What is the user trying to
              accomplish on this screen?” What is the primary, secondary, and maybe even tertiary
              objectives with this page?
              The overall objective of Fitted is to motivate people to workout. Fitness is a journey and
              it can get overwhelming if you think about all the workouts you have in front of you
              before your end goal. So I wanted to help users focus on today. That’s why the My
              Routine screen shows the users only what they have scheduled for today, with the main
              call to action being “Add Exercises”.
              Note: The call to action was changed to “Start Exercise” in high fidelity wireframes.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>The difference between mid-fidelity and high-fidelity mockups is simple. If it looks like an
              app that you would use, it’s high-fidelity. If the design isn’t there yet, it’s mid-fidelity.
              Most of the time, this comes down to refining the details of visual design.
              The guiding question is always the same: How can I remove obstacles for the user?
              Here’s an example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first major change was to add a dark grey gradient to the background. This
                gradient adds a more polished, defined look for the app.</li>
              <li>The next change was focused on improving the visual hierarchy of this screen. I
                asked myself “What is the user trying to achieve?” They want to see their
                progress. So I gave this content more space and reduced the size of the banner
                image and header text to help bring the user’s attention directly to the data.</li>
              <li>I also changed the data visualization. Rather than showing the user's progress on
                one goal at a time, I opted for a layout that allowed the user to see their progress
                on each of their goals all on one screen. This helps with the efficiency of the
                screen.</li>
              <li>I changed the primary CTA on this screen from “Start a Challenge” to a plus
                button. This plus button allows the user to add a new goal, which is more
                relevant to the rest of the content on this screen.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              This design successfully motivates users to reach their fitness goals by forming a
              cohesive brand identity. This was achieved by maintaining a fairly limited color palette,
              consistent design elements, and encouraging UX writing - guiding users to create a
              workout routine based on their skill level and interests.</p>
